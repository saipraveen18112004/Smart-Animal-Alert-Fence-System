SmartFence++ - Working Overview

1. Sensors (IR, PIR, Ultrasonic, LDR, DHT11) continuously monitor the field.
2. When movement is detected, ESP32-CAM captures the image.
3. YOLO model classifies the object as Animal or Human.
4. If Animal detected:
   - Relay triggers deterrents: LED, Buzzer, Water Pump.
   - SIM800L sends an SMS to the farmer.
   - Data is logged for analysis.
5. If no threat detected, system resets to standby mode.
